# ScannerApp
This is the android application for the automated microfilm scanner
This repository also contains the code for the arduino that we use to control the solenoids and motors as well as communicate with the phone via an HC-05 Bluetooth module

The mounts were 3D-printed using solidworks, the files are under the Final-3D-Designs directory and could use some reworking as it was very hard to fit the screws into some of them

the solenoids can be a little tempermental so just give them a gentle nudge if they dont engage
